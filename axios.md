**Axios** is a **JavaScript library** used to **send HTTP requests** from the browser or Node.js to a server.

---

### In simple words

> Axios helps your frontend **talk to the backend**.

---

### What Axios is used for

* Fetch data from APIs (GET)
* Send data to server (POST)
* Update data (PUT/PATCH)
* Delete data (DELETE)

Example use cases:

* Login request
* Fetch food menu
* Place an order

---

### Why Axios is popular

* Easy syntax
* Automatically converts JSON
* Better error handling than `fetch`
* Supports request/response interceptors
* Works in React & Node.js

---

### Axios in your food delivery project

> React uses Axios to call backend APIs for login, menu fetching, cart checkout, and order placement.

---

### Simple interview one-liner

> “Axios is a promise-based HTTP client used to communicate between frontend and backend.”

---

### Bonus (confidence add-on)

> “I use Axios instances to centralize API configuration.”

If you want, I can also explain:

* Axios vs Fetch
* Axios with authentication
* Axios interceptors
